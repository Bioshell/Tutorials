A few guides in how to use our tools, and some other people's tools as well.
All scripts mentioned in the tutorials are also included in this folder.

Amplicons_overlap will teach you how to use Usearch to process amplicon libraries where the forward and reverse sequencing reads overlap.

Amplicons_no-overlap does the same for the case where the reads don't (or rarely) overlap. This one is more convoluted, so do try to get overlaps.
